The following release versions are made based on major updates and testing of stability for framework base components (i.e. packages under \Core directory). 
\begin{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.3.1}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Bug fix in {\ttfamily mcshower} 
  \item Bug fix in {\ttfamily Geometry}
  \item Bug fix in {\ttfamily ana\_processor}
  \item Put capability to support multiple experiments in {\ttfamily LArUtil}
  \end{itemize}


\item[] {\bf v2.3.0}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Changed {\ttfamily data\_base} to sore association using {\ttfamily unsigned int} instead of {\ttfamily unsigned short}.
    \item Added {\ttfamily mcshower} object to store MC truth shower object.
    \item Use {\ttfamily larlight::hit} pointer instead of object in {\ttfamily ClusterParamsAlg}, better processing speed.
    \item Nice addition by Nathaniel which made {\ttfamily export MAKE\_TOP\_DIR} unnecessary ;)
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.2.2}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced ClusterRecoAlg under \UserDev. Some LArSoft algorithms are transported including HoughBaseAlg, ClusterParamsAlg, and ClusterMergeAlg
    \item Introduced ShowerAngleCluster in ClusterStudy package under \UserDev
    \item Fixed bugs in \LArUtil (bug in the stored TTree geometry data)
    \item Fixed minor bugs in \DataFormat and \Analysis
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.2.1}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Introduced \LArUtil package that contains {\it ala} LArSoft utility classes. Currently {\ttfamily Geometry}, {\ttfamily LArProperties}, {\ttfamily DetectorProperties}, and {\ttfamily GeometryUtilities}.
    \item Structural change: main packages (\Base, \DataFormat, \Analysis, \LArUtil) are now under \Core directory. {\ttfamily AnaProcess} is renamed to {\ttfamily UserDev} and stays as user's development area.
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.2.0}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Included {\ttfamily tpcfifo} and {\ttfamily pmtfifo} data products from David C.
    \item Included TriggerSim package for UB trigger algorithm simulation
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.1.1}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Included Bill's suggestion on the comments in the template source code
    \item Included empty \CPP class generation script in the bin directory of a user's analysis package
    \item Included a sample waveform generation code for example code in the manual
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.1.0}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Added {\ttfamily recob::EndPoint2D} and {\ttfamily recob::Vertex} equivalent data products
    \item Fixed {\ttfamily bin} directory compilation issue for Ubuntu 12.04LTS
  \end{itemize}

\item[] {\bf v2.0.0}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Initial frozen release upon presenting in Analysis Tool meeting. 
  \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
