When writing analysis/reconstruction code, eventually you will hit the point and ask ``where can I look up detector geometry?'' or ``How can I get detector parameters like electron lifetime?'' In LArSoft, there are \Geometry, \LArProperties,\DetectorProperties, and \GeometryUtilities service modules that can help you for such need. In LArLite, we implemented similar utility classes with the exact same name. This chapter describes about those utility classes.
