This chapter describes briefly about \Analysis package, the analysis framework of LArLite.
It comes in largely two pieces:
\begin{itemize}
\item \anaunit
\item \anaproc
\end{itemize}
The first bullet corresponds to LArSoft's ``module'' (i.e. {\ttfamily art::EDAnalyzer/EDProducer}).
The second bullet is an executor of \anaunit(s) by interfacing with {\ttfamily storage\_manager} (i.e. LArLite I/O interface class, see Sec.\ref{sec:io}). \\

Before going into details, do not misunderstand that you are constrained to do your analysis this way.
Like it was described in Sec.\ref{sec:io}, you have an interface to run your own event loop in whatever the way you wish.
Using the analysis framework is just a suggestion and not a requirement.
Or please share if you made something better ;)
