There are two basic classes used throughout the framework: 
(1) {\ttfamily larlight\_base} and (2) {\ttfamily Message}.
The first one is used as the base class of all framework classes except for data products.
The second class is a very simple {\ttfamily std::cout} and {\ttfamily std::cerr} message carriers.\\

Before wasting your 5 minutes, it's not very important to know about these classes unless you want to
use a color-coded message scheme.

\subsection{Message Carrier: {\ttfamily Message}}
This is actually not a logger.
It does only one thing: color code the message and add a prefix based on message level.

\subsection{Framework Base: {\ttfamily larlight\_base}}
This is the base class of all framework classes except for data products.
It comes with a verbosity level and makes a use of {\ttfamily Message} class
to deliver messages. It is implemented with {\ttfamily larlight\_base::print} attribute
which can mask out some low level messages based on the message level (i.e. {\ttfamily MSG::Level}).
