LArLite supports user code development under \UserDev.
More precisely, it is assumed to be under any path that is set to the value of shell environment variable {\ttfamily \$LARLITE\_USERDEVDIR}. 
For the sake of simplicity we stick with \UserDev in this section.

\subsection{Note About \UserDev}
Important note first:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\ttfamily UserDev/GNUmakefile}, if it exists, is generated by setup.sh and it does not belong to LArLite repository.
  \item Only directory that belongs to LArLite repository is {\ttfamily UserDev/bin}
  \item You can create anything under \UserDev (except under {\ttfamily UserDev/bin} and that don't have to worry about messing with LArLite repository.
\end{itemize}
This is all done through {\ttfamily .gitignore} rule placed under the top directory. 

These features of \UserDev are there so that you feel more free to make a mess (sorry, I meant, to develop code) there!

\subsection{Creating Your Sub-Repository in \UserDev}
\label{sec:devrepo:makenew}
Obviously I cannot just say ``do whatever under \UserDev'' and leave: I would love to support a very easy way to develop code (or make a mess) under \UserDev. I will just show you how to do things here:
\begin{lstlisting}
     > cd $LARLITE_USERDEVDIR
     > python bin/gen_new_repository MyRepo
\end{lstlisting}
This should create a new directory called {\ttfamily MyRepo} under \UserDev. That is your new repository. As said, this does not affect LArLite repository. If you don't want to keep {\ttfamily MyRepo}, simply ``{\ttfamily rm -r}'' it.

Another thing to note here: your repository will contain code and you will compile them, making a compiled shared object library. Your repository name will be used to name your library file (if you follow LArLite code generation scripts described in the followings). So pick a name that suits for your purpose. You do not want to pick a generic name that might coincide with some other libraries on your machine.

\subsection{What's in MyRepo?}

Your new repository comes with a GNUmakefile (which does nothing for now) and your {\it package generator} scripts under {\ttfamily MyRepo/bin} directory. By ``{\it package}'', what I mean is a directory under {\ttfamily MyRepo} with a set of header/source code with which a single compiled library can be generated.

These package generator scripts can be used to generate two kinds of packages: either plain \CPP package or LArLite analysis package. The former is handy to play with \CPP or write your own LArLite independent framework. The latter is obviously handy to develop your analysis or reconstruction code. For details, see Sec.\ref{sec:simplecpp} and \ref{sec:yourana}.

\subsection{Creating Your Sub-Repository in {\ttfamily github}}
In the previous section, we created a new repository {\ttfamily MyRepo} under \UserDev. But that's just a directory on your laptop, and you may want to keep it as your code repository using either {\ttfamily svn} or {\ttfamily github} (or anything else you would like to use). Here, I briefly mention how you can do this using {\ttfamily github} because it's very easy given that you already have a {\ttfamily github} account.

First of all, go to {\ttfamily github.com} and create your own repository: go to your {\ttfamily github} account web page, and click on ``+'' symbol that is toward right-top of the web page. Choose ``New repository''. Then enter the repository name you are about to create. Ideally you may want to choose a somewhat unique name as described in Sec.\ref{sec:devrepo:makenew}. You can always remove your repository if you don't like it.

Then checkout your empty repository. As an example, I use my empty repo called {\ttfamily EmptyRepo}.
\begin{lstlisting}
    > cd $LARLITE_USERDEVDIR
    > git clone git@github.com:drinkingkazu/EmptyRepo EmptyRepo
\end{lstlisting}
Now simply run:
\begin{lstlisting}
    > python bin/gen_new_repository EmptyRepo
    > cd EmptyRepo
    > git add .
    > git commit -m ``new repository''
    > gitpush -u origin master
\end{lstlisting}
and you are done!
From the next time, if you want to install LArLite from scratch, simply checkout your repository under UserDev with the same name.

As said many times, of course, your repository is independent of LArLite repository.
