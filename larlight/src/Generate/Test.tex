\subsection{Testing \Base}

\Base package only defines some base class and constants. 
You can test from your \CINT session.
\begin{lstlisting}
> root
root[0] gSystem->Load(``libBase'')
root[1] larlight::DATA::Event
\end{lstlisting}
Above lines are (1) loading compiled library for \Base package and (2) accessing defined constant in \Base package.
If you see no error message, that means your \Base package compilation was successful.

\subsection{Testing DataFormat}
For those who have \PyROOT, you can try invoking the following script to test if the build was successful or not.

\begin{lstlisting}
> cd $MAKE_TOP_DIR/AnaProcess/DataFormat/mac
> python test.py
\end{lstlisting}

This {\ttfamily test.py} script runs I/O handler class to open a \ROOT file and write some data in it.
If you see no issue running this script, then \DataFormat is compiled correctly
