You can find some of LArLite files under:
\begin{lstlisting}
/pnfs/uboone/scratch/uboonepro/mcc6.0_lite
\end{lstlisting}
directory path on {\ttfamily uboonegpvm} machines.
You may {\ttfamily rsync} them (as opposed to {\ttfamily scp}) to keep them
updated at your copied destination if you would like to move files to elsewhere.
These are produced with MCC 6.0.

Note some of those files are huge as they store very heavy information such as individual MC particle information.
Most likely what you need is a portion of them, and you should think before
blindly copy everything (like down to your laptop!).
