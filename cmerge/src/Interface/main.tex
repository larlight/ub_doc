{\cmtool} consists of a collection of simple {\CPP} and is (almost) independent of an analysis framework. Inparticular it is available in both {\larlight} and {\larsoft}. To support such structure, however, an interface to each framework is necessary. This chapter briefly describes an interface to supported analysis frameworks.
