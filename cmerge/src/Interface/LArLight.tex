Unfortunately there is no equivalent class of {\ttfamily ClusterMergeHelper} from {\larsoft} in {\larlight}. 
Instead there is a {\ttfamily ClusterMerger} analysis unit class (i.e. inherits from {\ttfamily ana\_processor}, see Ref.\cite{LArLight}). There is a viewer application to compare input clusters, output (i.e. merged) clusters, and {\ttfamily MCShower} data products to debug merging/prohibit algorithms. These are described in this section.

\subsection{{\ttfamily ClusterMerger}}
As mentioned already, this is an analysis unit in {\larlight}. The usage is described in Ref.\cite{LArLight}. 
By default, however, it does not save output cluster data product. 
This option (i.e. saving the output) can be enabled by the function:
\begin{lstlisting}
  void SaveOutputCluster(bool)
\end{lstlisting}
with a boolean value {\ttfamily true} as an argument. 
It can be disabled (though that is default) by providing {\ttfamily false}.
This module is mainly used to run merging on the fly by {\ttfamily MergeViewer}, the class that runs merging algorithm on the fly and show the result on the display.
That is why the saving out output data product is turned off by default.

\subsection{Viewer Application Classes}
This will be documented when the author finds time as it can be lengthy. 
It is fully functional and used intensively by a few users. 
Contact the author if interested in.
